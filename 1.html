        <p class="musk">“The Vible is a universal path into the door of faith in a grander plan. They remade a theory of belief, <br>
             placed it onto a single page on the internet, and made it atheist proof! 
             It seems inevitable paired with the branding to not have insane mimetic spread” -Elon Musk </p>

            Everything you can’t change happened for a good reason. If it did not, it is better to think that it did.
            Have faith things are going to be great. If you do, you’ll at least get closer to where you want to be. 
            Have Faith in having Faith, and nothing can limit it.
            Limitless faith leads to limitless hope
            Limitless hope leads to limitless love
            Limitless love is the vibe of heaven
            Together, through faith, we can bear witness to heaven.
            Don’t doubt the vibe, spread it.
            Gods amazing grace is coming back.<br>
            <br>
            We lost our hope when we lost our faith.
            Now our faith is returning and with it a new hope will multiply.
            For hope is a necessary ingredient for our hopes to become reality.
            Our dreams is only limited by how hard we can meme.
            The universe was made for you, if it wasn't, it is better to think that it was.
            To some extent (perhaps a greater extent than we can yet quite fathom), how we perceive and approach the world creates a world that 
            appears to us in that form — as “real.” <br> 
            <br>
            As Werner Heisenberg put it: “What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” 
            The future is going to be better than you can imagine, if it’s not it’s better to think that it is. 
            Not just because it gives you better vibes in the moment, but because it actually increases the chance that it is better. 
            Our limits are only defined by how high we meme.
